Project 4 Discussion Log

I found myself at odds with my smart computer module for a great deal of time while I put together this project. It seemed to always find a new and inventive way to cheat at the game after I had foiled its last attempt. First, it often took a number greater than half of the marbles in the pile. I solved that issue by adding a second if statement that looked at the number of marbles the computer wanted to take, and then checking that it was in fact half or fewer than the number of marbles in the pile. If it was, the number was changed so that the computer would take the difference between the marbles in the pile minus the next highest power of two, subtracted by one. This resulted in a smaller number of marbles being subtracted from the pile. Next, if the number of marbles in the pile was a power of two minus one, such as after I took a turn, the computer would throw a tantrum and refuse to take any marbles, forcing me to go again, and if the number of marbles in the pile is already a power of two minus one, taking the difference between that number and the next power of two minus one isn't a legal move. That way, the computer would always steal the game from me if I was winning. I solved that issue so that whenever the computer wanted to take no marbles, it would instead take a random number. The latest problem I had was that at the very end of the game, if it looked like I had the computer beat, it would skip my turn and take one more marble, leaving the last marble in the pile for me. I'm not certain exactly which pieces of code I changed so that this no longer happens, but it doesn't now, and I'm okay with that. Coding the game so that the correct win conditions would trigger was much more difficult than I anticipated. My first system for determining the winner was by keeping a count of the how many turns each player took, but that proved to be an ineffective and unreliable way of determining the winner of the game. I switched to using two booleans, isHumansTurn and isComputersTurn, and even then I had great difficulty in getting the game to display the correct win message. I had the boolean assignments and method call to my winConditions() method in the play method at first, but that hardly ever gave the correct result. What I found works was by having my turn assignments and win condition triggers within my three player modules, humanTurn, dumbComputerTurn, and smartComputerTurn.
